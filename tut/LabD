## DataBinding

### Setup
- Download and run <http://github.com/topseed/topseed> as per instructions there.
- Install  <http://tinyurl.com/mjeka4j> A browser plugin for REST
- Required IDE: <http://code.visualstudio.com> (so you can get instructor support)
- Use Chrome browser. Click menu (:) on right/ More Tools/ Developer Toools. This will show you 'console' for: console.log('here'); in .js.
- Not required: prepros.io
- Recommended: also deploy webApp to <https://zeit.co>. This way you start learning how to have a learning web site.

### Goals
You will practice front end data-binding a few different ways (browser, server, web component, etc). Pro-musicians and pro-basketball players practice, so should you. Ideally you know of Sass, Scss or LESS and have more that just a few years out of school, this is not suitable for people with only a few years experience just out of school, you need some experience deploying webapps.

### MicroService, REST(y) and Fetch()
You have setup Advanced REST Client above, run it:
- https://middle4top-vgylwtpbxs.now.sh/membersPg/mem
- https://middle4top-vgylwtpbxs.now.sh/membersPg/list

Both should return some data on a POST.
